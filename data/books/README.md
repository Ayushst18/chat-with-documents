# Sample Data Directory

This directory is where you should place your PDF documents for processing.

## Instructions:

1. Add your PDF files to this directory
2. Run `python database.py` to process and index them
3. Start querying with `python retrieve.py "your question"`

## Note:

The PDF files are not included in the repository due to size constraints. Users should add their own documents here.
